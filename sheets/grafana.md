# Strategies to reduce database load caused by Grafana dashboards

---

### 1. **Increase Dashboard Refresh Intervals**

* Set longer refresh intervals on dashboards or panels so queries run less frequently.
* Avoid very short intervals (e.g., less than 30 seconds) unless necessary.

### 2. **Use Query Result Caching or Materialized Views**

* Create **materialized views** in your database that pre-aggregate or pre-compute expensive queries.
* Refresh these materialized views periodically (e.g., every 5 minutes).
* Point Grafana at these views instead of querying raw tables.

### 3. **Optimize Queries**

* Ensure queries are well-indexed and efficient.
* Avoid SELECT \* â€” select only needed columns.
* Use appropriate time filtering and limits.
* Use `time_bucket` or similar functions (TimescaleDB, PostgreSQL) to reduce granularity.

### 4. **Use a Proxy or Cache Layer**

* Use caching proxies like **Redis**, **Varnish**, or custom proxy layers between Grafana and the database.
* Some data sources support query caching plugins or extensions.

### 5. **Downsample Data**

* Store downsampled or summarized data for longer time ranges.
* Query detailed data only for short time windows.

### 6. **Limit Dashboard Complexity**

* Reduce the number of panels and queries per dashboard.
* Use variables and template queries efficiently to minimize redundant queries.

### 7. **Use Data Source Features**

* Some data sources like Prometheus or Elasticsearch have their own query caching or data retention settings.
* Configure those to optimize load.

### 8. **Use Alerting Instead of Continuous Querying**

* Configure Grafana alerts to run less frequently or use threshold triggers instead of constant dashboard refreshes.

### Bonus: Example for PostgreSQL

* Use **TimescaleDB continuous aggregates** for pre-aggregated time-series data.
* Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to check query plans and improve performance.
* Create indexes on time and filtering columns.

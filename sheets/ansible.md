# Run Once In Dev
When using Ansible with a setup where three logical servers are on the same physical machine during development, you can use a combination of strategies to ensure tasks and roles are executed only once. Here are a few approaches:

---

### **Option 1: Use Host Facts or Variables to Identify Single Physical Machine**
Set a unique variable or fact on the physical machine and use a condition to execute tasks or roles only if the condition matches.

#### Example Inventory
```yaml
all:
  children:
    logical_servers:
      hosts:
        server1:
          ansible_host: 127.0.0.1
          is_physical: true
        server2:
          ansible_host: 127.0.0.1
        server3:
          ansible_host: 127.0.0.1
```

#### Playbook with Conditional Execution
```yaml
- name: Ensure tasks execute only once
  hosts: logical_servers
  gather_facts: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Run task only if physical server
      debug:
        msg: "This task runs only once on the physical server"
      when: inventory_hostname == "server1"
```

Here, tasks will only execute for `server1`, preventing redundant executions for `server2` and `server3`.

---

### **Option 2: Use the `run_once` Directive**
The `run_once` directive ensures a task runs only once, regardless of how many hosts are in the inventory.

#### Playbook Example
```yaml
- name: Ensure tasks execute only once
  hosts: logical_servers
  tasks:
    - name: This task runs only once
      debug:
        msg: "This task runs once for all logical servers"
      run_once: true
```

This approach is useful when the task doesn't depend on which host executes it, but should apply globally.

---

### **Option 3: Group Variables to Designate a Primary Server**
Use a group variable to designate one host as the "primary" host for tasks.

#### Inventory
```yaml
all:
  children:
    logical_servers:
      hosts:
        server1:
          ansible_host: 127.0.0.1
        server2:
          ansible_host: 127.0.0.1
        server3:
          ansible_host: 127.0.0.1
      vars:
        primary_server: server1
```

#### Playbook Example
```yaml
- name: Execute tasks only on primary server
  hosts: logical_servers
  tasks:
    - name: This task runs only on the primary server
      debug:
        msg: "Running on the primary server"
      when: inventory_hostname == primary_server
```

---

### **Option 4: Deduplicate Roles Using `delegate_to`**
Run the role on only one host and delegate its execution to the primary server.

#### Playbook Example
```yaml
- name: Run roles only once
  hosts: logical_servers
  tasks:
    - name: Execute role on primary server
      include_role:
        name: your_role
      delegate_to: server1
      run_once: true
```

---

### **Best Practice Recommendation**
- During development, use `run_once` for general tasks or designate a "primary" server in your inventory with group variables.
- For production, ensure all logical servers are treated independently to reflect the real-world setup.

# SSH Keys
To run Ansible using SSH keys instead of an SSH login with a password, follow these steps:

### 1. **Generate SSH Key Pair**
If you donâ€™t already have an SSH key pair, generate one:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

Save the key pair in the default location (`~/.ssh/id_rsa`).

### 2. **Copy the Public Key to the Target Hosts**
Transfer your public key (`~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`) to the target hosts:

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa user@target_host
```

Replace `user` with the username and `target_host` with the hostname or IP address of your target machine.

Alternatively, you can manually append the public key to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the target host.

### 3. **Configure Ansible Inventory**
Ensure your Ansible inventory file (`inventory` or `hosts`) lists the target hosts. For example:

```ini
[target_group]
target_host ansible_user=user
```

Replace `target_host` with the hostname or IP of the target machine and `user` with the SSH username.

### 4. **Specify the Private Key in Ansible**
You can specify the private key in multiple ways:

#### Option A: **Command Line**
Pass the private key using the `--private-key` option:

```bash
ansible -i inventory target_group -m ping --private-key ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

#### Option B: **ansible.cfg**
Edit your `ansible.cfg` file to include the path to the private key:

```ini
[defaults]
inventory = inventory
remote_user = user
private_key_file = ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

#### Option C: **Playbook-Specific Configuration**
In your playbook YAML file, use the `ansible_ssh_private_key_file` variable:

```yaml
- hosts: target_group
  vars:
    ansible_ssh_private_key_file: ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  tasks:
    - name: Ping the target
      ping:
```

### 5. **Test the Configuration**
Verify the setup by pinging the target hosts:

```bash
ansible -i inventory target_group -m ping
```

If configured correctly, Ansible should connect to the target hosts without prompting for a password.
